            <h3>Blocking Strikes</h3>
            <p>Blocking can involve a variety of techniques. The most common is protecting your head and body with your arms.<br>Boxers are taught to keep their arms up so that can move them quickly to their face to block a punch.</p>
            <p>Another technique is the light footwork. The lighter you are on your feet, the easier it is to evade your attacker.<br>boxer’s stance allows them to shift their weight back and forth between their feet to change direction at a moment’s notice.</p>

            <h3>Striking Accuracy</h3>
            <p>A boxer’s stance will help to ground their strikes.<br>Planting your foot and swinging your hips gives a punch much more power than if you were to just use the strength of your shoulders.</p>
            <p>Although it may not be your original intention to cause your opponent damage in a self-defense situation,<br>doing so can stun or knock out your opponent, giving you time to escape.</p>
